After installing, you need to manually link the Dropbox Client to the respective account

$HOME/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd

You should see output like this:

This client is not linked to any account... Please visit https://www.dropbox.com/cli_link?host_id=7d44a557aa43f285dawc2c7334d02c1 to link this machine.
